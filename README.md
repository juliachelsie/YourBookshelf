## Design

**Colour**
- I Choose to go with a very simple colour scheme, since there are so many products that are colourful.
- On the header and footer there is a white background.
- I used colour #42418b on the delivery banner, when hoovering on all the buttons and on the social media icons
![Palette](https://github.com/juliachelsie/YourBookshelf/blob/main/media/palette.PNG)


**Typography**
- I used 'Inter', sans-serif.

## Testing

### Testing with unittests in Python/Django.

- I have used django unittests to test all my code in models.py, views.py, urls.py and forms.py. The tests are all located in the apps tests.py.

### Testing via validators

**CSS**
- No errors were returned when passing through the official [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

**HTML**

- An error appeard in the html saying "Element li not allowed as child of element nav". The li element actually is in the nav element, but the validator don't recognize it.
- Besides from that there are no errors or warnings. [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)

**PYTHON**

- I have tested the code via [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).
- There were one specific error that came up more than once, saying that (line too long ( x > x characters) ). The website is working fine even though the errors are there. But when i correct the errors, the code is not working as it should and i get different type of errors that makes the website not work. This is something i will correct as soon as possible!

**JAVASCRIPT**

- I have tested the code and it returned no errors [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

### Testing via lighthouse

- I have tested the website in Devtools Lighthouse. The results are mostly good

## Different web browsers.

- I have tested it on Microsoft Edge and it works with no problems.
- I have tested it on Google Chrome and it  wors with no problems.

## Unfixed bugs

- When loading some of the pages, devtools lighthouse give me pretty bad "performance numbers" on both mobile and desktop devices. I think this is because the images are to large and they take a while to load. I would like to fix this issue by scaling the images down in size, when i have access to a affordable image editing service.
- There were a problem when i tried to insert the function to send real emails, this is also something i want to try to implement successfully as soon as possible.

## Fixed bugs

- 

### How does it look on different screen sizes?
